Look at the tasks in Milestone : adc16227-d589-4b0a-86fe-5ad60405339f
Mark the next task in that milestone as In Progress using the API, and start the implementation
When finished the implementaion, mark the task as Pending Validation using the API




Persona: LeadEngineer
Goal: Build a UI surface that displays the project’s Next Suggested Action (NSA) along with a clear rationale (reasons/explanations) and links to any blockers. Ship it behind a safe, minimal vertical slice using our current stack.

In progress Milestone : adc16227-d589-4b0a-86fe-5ad60405339f
Mark the next task in that milestone as In Progress using the API, and start the implementation.
Task ID: 2f012a91-2b2b-4e36-b27d-31ffe1cdc0d2

- Relevant API (per spec v1):
 - GET /v1/projects/{id}/next-action[?persona=...] → returns top suggestions with reasons[] and task metadata (see example below).
 - GET /v1/tasks/{id} → returns task details; tasks may have blocked_by: UUID[].

- UX requirement for this milestone:
 - Show one primary next action (or a small list) with rationale bullets.
 - For any blockers, render links to the blocked tasks’ detail routes (/tasks/:id) and visually flag that the next action is blocked until those are resolved.
- Provide persona filter (chip/dropdown) to see NSA for a specific persona.
- Support loading / error / empty states and accessible keyboard navigation.

- Data notes:
 - NSA payload includes reasons (strings) and may include blockers by id or be derivable via the task’s blocked_by.
 - If the NSA endpoint only returns task_id and reasons, you must fetch blockers via GET /v1/tasks/{task_id} and then map blocked_by[] → task titles via parallel fetches.

- Routing:
 - Projects list → /projects/:id
 - Task detail → /tasks/:id

Examine the milestones and tasks remaining along with the existing status for project c86f7594-ff72-486c-970e-913322ccdbd0
Then update the project status with the current state of the project


New priority - I would like the activity log to capture changes in state, and also allow agents to add summaries of their actions to the log
Update the Next Suggested Actions to reflect that priority
