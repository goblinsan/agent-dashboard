# Execution Plan (Dogfood MVP)

## Objective
Reach a usable vertical slice that lets us plan this project **inside** the product within 5–7 working days.

## Milestone: MVP0 — Vertical Slice
- **Phase A — Infra & API skeleton (Day 1–2)**
  - [x] Docker compose (Postgres, Redis, API, Web)
  - [x] Alembic migration for `projects`, `milestones`, `phases`, `tasks` (phases optional)
  - [x] Endpoints: `.well-known/schemas`, `POST/GET /v1/projects`, `POST/GET /v1/milestones`, `POST/GET /v1/tasks`
  - [x] Optimistic locking on `PATCH /v1/tasks/:id`
- **Phase B — Web UI skeleton (Day 2–3)**
  - [x] Dashboard list of projects
  - [x] Create project form (barebones)
  - [x] Task list under milestone; inline add task
- **Phase C — Roll-ups & NSA stubs (Day 3–4)**
  - [x] `/v1/projects/:id/status` computed with remaining hours
  - [x] `/v1/projects/:id/next-action` returns top 3 placeholders
- **Phase D — Dogfood & Iterate (Day 4–5)**
  - [x] Create this project in the tool and import this plan as tasks
  - [x] Daily status summary generated by API and shown on dashboard

## Milestone: MVP1 — Usability
- [ ] Personas registry + limits (read-only UI)
- [ ] Basic bug tracker (CRUD, link to tasks)
- [ ] Event log (append-only) + activity view

## Definition of Ready
- API & DB up with a single command; OpenAPI docs available; can create/list projects, milestones, tasks.

## Definition of Done
- We can manage this execution plan entirely from the app: add tasks, mark progress, see remaining, and view Next Suggested Action.
