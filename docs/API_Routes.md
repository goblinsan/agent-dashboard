| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/projects` | List projects. Optional `parent_id` query for nested setups. |
| `POST` | `/v1/projects` | Create a project (`name`, optional `goal`, `direction`, `parent_id`). |
| `GET` | `/v1/projects/{project_id}` | Retrieve a single project. |
| `GET` | `/v1/projects/{project_id}/status` | Aggregated effort + completion metrics for the project. |
| `GET` | `/v1/projects/{project_id}/status/summary` | Natural language daily summary. |
| `GET` | `/v1/projects/{project_id}/next-action` | Top task suggestions based on priority heuristics. |

**Create a project**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Vertical Slice","goal":"Ship MVP0"}'
```

## Milestones

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/milestones` | List milestones. Filter with `project_id`. |

## Quick Workflow Example

```bash

PROJECT_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Dogfood MVP"}' | jq -r '.id')

MILESTONE_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/milestones \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id":"'"$PROJECT_ID"'","name":"Vertical Slice"}' | jq -r '.id')

# 2) Create a task
TASK_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"milestone_id":"'"$MILESTONE_ID"'","title":"Set up dev env"}' | jq -r '.id')

# 3) Log an event tied to the task
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/events \

## Notes
- All timestamps are stored/returned in UTC with timezone information.
- DELETE endpoints respond with `204 No Content` when successful.
- For convenience, the `docs/Execution_Plan_Dogfood_MVP.md` file tracks high-level roadmap status if you need context on recommended workflows.
